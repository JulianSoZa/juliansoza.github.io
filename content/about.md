## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm glad you're here! ðŸ˜€

Welcome to my personal blog ðŸ˜Š! My name is JuliÃ¡n, and I am a fourth-year Physics Engineering student at EAFIT University, with a strong passion for academic research in applied sciences and the development of new technologies. My interests include forward and inverse modeling of wave propagation, particularly in biomedical optics (light-tissue interaction) and seismology. I am also interested in potential field theory in geophysics, such as gravity and magnetism.

I am currently collaborating on two research projects: *Geological Lineament Detection*, and *Forward and Inverse Modelling of Wave Propagation*, as a research intern of the Mathematical Applications in Science and Engineering Research Group.
